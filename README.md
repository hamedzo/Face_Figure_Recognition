# Face Figure Recognition with MediaPipe

A lightweight and efficient project for real-time face figure recognition using [MediaPipe](https://mediapipe.dev/), a cross-platform framework for building multimodal applied machine learning pipelines.

## 📸 Project Overview

This project utilizes **MediaPipe Face Mesh** and related modules to detect and recognize human facial features in real-time. It can be used in applications such as:

- Facial landmark detection
- Facial structure analysis
- Gesture and emotion recognition
- Head pose estimation
- Biometric and identity recognition (as a baseline)

## 🎯 Objectives

- Detect human faces from video input (webcam or video file)
- Identify and annotate facial landmarks
- Analyze facial figure metrics (e.g. eye distance, face symmetry, head orientation)
- Create a scalable base for future face-related AI models

## ✨ Features

- 🧠 Facial landmark detection (468 points)
- ⏱ Real-time video processing with OpenCV
- 🔍 Face figure analysis (geometry-based)
- 🖼 Visualizations of landmark points and measurements
- 💡 Easy to extend for emotion recognition, face classification, etc.
