# Face Figure Recognition with MediaPipe

A lightweight, efficient, and extensible project for real-time face figure recognition using [MediaPipe](https://mediapipe.dev/)—a cutting-edge, cross-platform framework for building multimodal machine learning pipelines.

---

## 📸 Project Overview

This project leverages **MediaPipe Face Mesh** and supporting modules to detect and analyze human facial features in real time. It is suitable for a range of applications, including:

- Facial landmark detection
- Facial structure and symmetry analysis
- Gesture and emotion recognition
- Head pose estimation
- Baseline biometric/identity recognition

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Detect human faces from live video (webcam or video files)
- Identify and annotate 468 facial landmarks per face
- Analyze facial metrics (eye distance, face symmetry, head orientation, etc.)
- Offer a scalable foundation for advanced face-related AI models

---

## ✨ Features

- 🧠 **Facial Landmark Detection:** 468-point mesh per face using MediaPipe
- ⏱ **Real-Time Processing:** Smooth video stream handling via OpenCV
- 🔍 **Geometry-Based Analysis:** Extract face metrics for symmetry, proportions, etc.
- 🖼 **Rich Visualizations:** Overlay landmark points and facial measurements on frames
- 💡 **Extensible Design:** Easily add emotion recognition, face classification, and more

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- [Python 3.7+](https://www.python.org/)
- [MediaPipe](https://google.github.io/mediapipe/)
- [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/)
- [NumPy](https://numpy.org/)

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/hamedzo/Face_Recognition.git
cd Face_Recognition
```

### 2. (Optional) Create a Virtual Environment

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Run the Application

```bash
python main.py
```

## 🧠 How It Works

The pipeline is as follows:

1. **Face Detection:** Locates and tracks faces in the input stream.
2. **Landmark Extraction:** Maps 468 facial landmarks per detected face.
3. **Rendering:** Overlays the mesh and keypoints on frames using OpenCV.
4. **Multi-Face Support:** Tracks and analyzes multiple faces in real time.
