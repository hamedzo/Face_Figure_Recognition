# Face Figure Recognition with MediaPipe

A lightweight and efficient project for real-time face figure recognition using [MediaPipe](https://mediapipe.dev/), a cross-platform framework for building multimodal applied machine learning pipelines.

## 📸 Project Overview

This project utilizes **MediaPipe Face Mesh** and related modules to detect and recognize human facial features in real-time. It can be used in applications such as:

- Facial landmark detection
- Facial structure analysis
- Gesture and emotion recognition
- Head pose estimation
- Biometric and identity recognition (as a baseline)

## 🎯 Objectives

- Detect human faces from video input (webcam or video file)
- Identify and annotate facial landmarks
- Analyze facial figure metrics (e.g. eye distance, face symmetry, head orientation)
- Create a scalable base for future face-related AI models

## ✨ Features

- 🧠 Facial landmark detection (468 points)
- ⏱ Real-time video processing with OpenCV
- 🔍 Face figure analysis (geometry-based)
- 🖼 Visualizations of landmark points and measurements
- 💡 Easy to extend for emotion recognition, face classification, etc.

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- [Python 3.7+](https://www.python.org/)
- [MediaPipe](https://google.github.io/mediapipe/)
- [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/)
- [NumPy](https://numpy.org/)

## 🛠️ Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/face-figure-recognition-mediapipe.git
cd face-figure-recognition-mediapipe

### 2. Create a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended)
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

### 3. Install Dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

## 🚀 Usage

## Run the application
python main.py

## 🧠 How It Works
This project uses the MediaPipe Face Mesh pipeline:

 1. Face Detection – Detects and tracks faces in the image.

 2. Landmark Extraction – Maps 468 facial landmarks per face in real time.

 3. Rendering – Draws facial mesh and key points using OpenCV.

 4. The model runs in real time and is capable of tracking multiple faces simultaneously.

## 📸 Sample Output

## ✅ Requirements
